# Advanced Topic 2: Deployment Strategies

Learn about different deployment strategies for your Docusaurus site.

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions
Set up automated deployments with GitHub Actions:
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build website
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
```

## Docker Deployment

### Dockerfile
Create a Docker container for your site:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "serve"]
```

### Docker Compose
Set up with Docker Compose:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  docusaurus:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./docs:/app/docs
```

## Cloud Deployment

### AWS Amplify
Deploy to AWS Amplify:
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: build
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

### Netlify
Configure Netlify deployment:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "18" }

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
Implement basic health monitoring:
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

### Performance Monitoring
Set up performance tracking:
```javascript
console.log('Performance monitoring setup here');
// Add your preferred monitoring solution
```
